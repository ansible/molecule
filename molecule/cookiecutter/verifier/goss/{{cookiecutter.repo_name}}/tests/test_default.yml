# This is an example playbook to execute goss tests.
# Tests need distributed to the appropriate ansible host/groups
# prior to execution by `goss validate`.
#
# The goss ansible module is installed with molecule.  The ANSIBLE_LIBRARY
# path is updated appropriately on `molecule verify`.

# Details about ansible module:
