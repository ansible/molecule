    `Goss`_ is not the default test runner.

    `Goss`_ is a YAML based serverspec-like tool for validating a server's
    configuration.  `Goss`_ is `not` the default verifier used in Molecule.

    Molecule executes a playbook (`verify.yml`) located in the role's
    `scenario.directory`.  This playbook will copy YAML files to the instances,
    and execute Goss using a community written Goss Ansible module bundled with
    Molecule.

    Additional options can be passed to `goss validate` by modifying the verify
    playbook.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        verifier:
          name: goss
          lint:
            name: yamllint

    The testing can be disabled by setting `enabled` to False.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        verifier:
          name: goss
          enabled: False

    Environment variables can be passed to the verifier.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        verifier:
          name: goss
          env:
            FOO: bar

    Change path to the test directory.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        verifier:
          name: goss
          directory: /foo/bar/

    .. important::

        Due to the nature of this verifier.  Molecule does not perform options
        handling in the same fashion as Testinfra.
