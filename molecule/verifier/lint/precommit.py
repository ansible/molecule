    Pre-commit tool verifier wrapper.

    This class is used to lint files by executing the pre-commit
    command line tool for files in the test folder with a prefix
    of ``test_``.

    `Pre-Commit`_ is not the default verifier linter.

    `Pre-Commit`_ is a linter for python files and more.

    Additional options can be passed to ``pre-commit`` through the options
    dict.  Any option set in this section will override the defaults.

        verifier:
          name: testinfra
          lint:
            name: pre-commit
            options:
              remove-tabs:

    Test file linting can be disabled by setting ``enabled`` to False.

    Environment variables can be passed to lint.
