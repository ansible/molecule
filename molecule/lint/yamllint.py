    `Yamllint`_ is the default projet linter.

    `Yamllint`_ is a linter for YAML files.  In addition to checking for syntax
    validity, also checks for key repetition, and cosmetic problems such as
    lines length, trailing spaces, and indentation.

    Additional options can be passed to `yamllint` through the options
    dict.  Any option set in this section will override the defaults.

          name: yamllint

          name: yamllint
