    """
    `Shell` is an alternate dependency manager.  It is intended to run a
    command in situations where `Ansible Galaxy`_ and `Gilt`_ don't suffice.

    The `command` to execute is required, and is relative to Molecule's project
    directory when referencing a script not in $PATH.

    .. note::

        Unlike the other dependency managers, `options` are ignored and not
        passed to `shell`.  Additional flags/subcommands should simply be added
        to the `command`.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        dependency:
          name: shell
          command: path/to/command --flag1 subcommand --flag2

    The dependency manager can be disabled by setting `enabled` to False.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        dependency:
          name: shell
          command: path/to/command --flag1 subcommand --flag2
          enabled: False

    Environment variables can be passed to the dependency.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        dependency:
          name: shell
