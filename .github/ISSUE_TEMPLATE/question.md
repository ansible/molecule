Please do not create a GitHub issue if you have a question. Instead ask on
StackOverflow and add `molecule` label to your question.

Alternatively you can try to use the mailing list from
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/molecule-users but that method should
be used only if the question is not appropriate for StackOverflow.

New questions from StackOverflow are automatically advertised on our FreeNode
irc channel ``#ansible-molecule``.

**Questions added on GitHub will be closed.**
