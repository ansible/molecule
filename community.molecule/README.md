# Molecule Collection

[![CI](https://github.com/ansible/molecule/actions/workflows/tox.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/ansible/molecule/actions/workflows/tox.yml) [![Codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/ansible/molecule)](https://codecov.io/gh/ansible/molecule)

`community.molecule` collection aims to help molecule users to write and maintain their
molecule tests.

This collection contains:

- filters that can be used inside molecule testing playbooks
- examples on how to use molecule for testing content with different type of
  infrastructure.

## External requirements

Filters and modules provided do require molecule python package to be installed
and they are not supposed to be used outside molecule testing playbooks.

## Release notes

See the [changelog](https://github.com/ansible/molecule/tree/main/community.molecule/CHANGELOG.rst).
