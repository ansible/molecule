Molecule
========

Molecule is designed to aid in the development and testing of
`Ansible`_ roles including support for multiple instances,
operating system distributions, virtualization providers and test frameworks.

It leverages `Vagrant`_, `Docker`_, `OpenStack`_, and `libvirt`_ to manage
virtual machines/containers, with support for multiple Vagrant providers
(currently VirtualBox, Parallels and VMware Fusion).  Molecule supports
`Serverspec`_ or `Testinfra`_ to run tests.  Molecule uses an `Ansible`_
`playbook`_ (``playbook.yml``), to execute the `role`_ and its tests.

Some of the UI was inspired by `Test Kitchen`_.
