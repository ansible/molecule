.. _openstack_driver_usage:

OpenStack
=========

The openstack driver will create instances in your openstack service. The
environment variables required to use this driver can be found in the RC file
provided on your openstack site.

Options
-------

* ``name`` - name of the openstack instance
* ``image`` - openstack image to use for instance
* ``flavor`` - openstack flavor to use for instance
* ``sshuser`` - user to access ssh with
* ``ansible_groups`` - a list of groups the instance(s) belong to in Ansible
  and/or a list of lists for assigning the instance(s) to child groups.
* ``security_groups`` - security groups the instance belongs to in openstack

The ``keypair`` and ``keyfile`` options may also be given to specify the
keypair to use when accessing your openstack service. If neither ``keypair`` nor
``keyfile`` are specified molecule will generate a ssh public and private key
and use the public key to create a keypair in your openstack service. If only
``keyfile`` is specified, but no ``keypair``, molecule will attempt to locate
the public key associated with the ``keyfile`` and use it to generate a keypair
in your openstack service. Any dynamic ssh keys or keypairs generated by
molecule will be deleted on destroy.

Usage can be seen in the example below.
