Testing
=======

Molecule has an extensive set of unit and functional tests.  Molecule uses
`Tox`_ `Factors`_ to generate a matrix of python x Ansible x unit/functional
tests.  Manual setup required as of this time.

Dependencies
------------

Tests will be skipped when the driver's binary is not present.

Install the test framework `Tox`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install tox

Install the remaining requirements in a venv (optional).

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -r test-requirements.txt -r requirements.txt

.. _`Tox`: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest

Run all unit tests with coverage.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tox -e $(tox -l | grep unit | paste -d, -s -)
