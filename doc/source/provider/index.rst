Vagrant uses `provider plugins`_ to support managing machines onvarious
virtualization platforms. There are workstation-local provider plugins
such as `VirtualBox`_ and VMware Fusion/Workstation and cloud-based providers
such as AWS/EC2.

Molecule can be configured to give provider-specific configuration data in
`molecule.yml` - in the `vagrant.providers` hash. Necessarily, the configuration
requirements/options are much more complicated for cloud-based providers than they
are for workstation-local virtualization provider plugins.
