Molecule is designed to aid in the development and testing of
`Ansible`_ roles.

Molecule provides support for testing with multiple instances, operating
systems and distributions, virtualization providers, test frameworks and
testing scenarios.

Molecule encourages an approach that results in consistently developed roles
that are well-written, easily understood and maintained.
