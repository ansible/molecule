About Ansible Molecule
======================

Molecule project is designed to aid in the development and testing of
`Ansible`_ roles.

Molecule provides support for testing with multiple instances, operating
systems and distributions, virtualization providers, test frameworks and
testing scenarios.

Molecule encourages an approach that results in consistently developed roles
that are well-written, easily understood and maintained.

Molecule supports only the latest two major versions of Ansible (N/N-1),
meaning that if the latest version is 2.9.x, we will also test our code with
2.8.x.

Once installed, the command line can be called using any of the methods below:

.. code-block:: bash

    molecule ...
    mol ...  # same as above, introduced in 3.0.5
    python3 -m molecule ...  # python module calling method
