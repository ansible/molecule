* Added Inspec verifier.
* Added RuboCop linter for Inspec.

Breaking Changes
----------------

* Render inventory links relative to scenario dir instead of ephemeral dir.
  Unfortunately, this was a side effect of #1218.

2.12.1
======

* Disable pytest caching plugin.

Important Changes
-----------------

* No longer need to `.gitignore` the `.pytest_cache/` directory.

2.12
====

* Ensure prune properly removes empty dirs.
* Allow verify playbook to be shared.
* Added cookiecutter tests.
* Moved temporary files to $TMPDIR.
* Added and tested Ansible 2.5 support.
* Remove include tasks from driver playbooks.
* Set `delete_fip = yes` for os_server resources.

  `molecule/$role_name/$scenario_name/`.  Temporary files are no longer
  written to `$scenario_directory/.molecule/`.
* No longer need to `.gitignore` the `.molecule/` directory.

Breaking Changes
----------------

* Users of the Goss verifier will need to change their `verifier.yml` playbook
  to `verify.yml`.

2.11
====

* Correct verbose flag options with `--debug`.
* Bumped Ansible 2.4 and 2.3 minor versions.
* Reimplemented schema validation with Cerberus.
* Bumped version of jinja2.
* Move merge_dicts into util.
* Forward port Molecule v1 shell dependency manager.
* Vagrantfile cleanup.
* Ability to log into a Docker registry.

Important Changes
-----------------

* Reimplemented schema validation with Cerberus.  The Molecule file is
  thoroughly validated.  This may result in validation errors if the
  developer's `molecule.yml` is doing something unusual.

* Cleaned up the Vagrantfile, and allow the developer to change options
  on the base Vagrant config object.

Breaking Changes
----------------

* Changed Vagrant's `molecule.yml` `raw_config_args` to
  `provider_raw_config_args` for differentiating
  `instance_raw_config_args`.

2.10.1
======

* Correct Vagrant to automatically insert a keypair.
* Corrected synced_folders usage.

2.10
====

* Properly skipping Vagrant speedup keys in provider.
* Allow Vagrant to automatically insert a keypair.
* Correct molecule_vagrant.py bug where `provider_options`
  would cause Vagrant to fail if keys from #1147 were provided.
* Fix line length in cookie cutter README.

Important Changes
-----------------

* PR #1147 reduced Vagrant create time, which disabled Vagrant from
  automatically inserting a keypair.  Molecule's default is now changed
  back to Vagrant's default of True, which may reduce the speed of Vagrant
  create as fixed by #1147.

2.9
===

* Bumped yamllint version.
* Namespaced Docker registry.
* Reduce create time with Vagrant driver.
* Replace >>> with $ in documentation.
* Moved prune to run after destroy.
* Fix confusion between exposed and published ports in docker create
  playbook.

* Disallow privilege_escalation via schema.
* Validate schema for invalid ansible config options.
* Adding provision option for Vagrant driver.

Important Changes
-----------------

* These changes do not impact existing projects.  However, if one was using the
  old syntax, and upgraded create.yml, changes would be required.  The Docker
  driver's registry has been moved to a key named `url` under `registry`.

.. code-block:: yaml

    driver:
      name: docker
    platforms:
      - name: instance
        image: image_name:tag
        registry:
          url: registry.example.com

* Fix confusion between exposed and published ports in docker create playbook.

.. code-block:: yaml

    driver:
      name: docker
    platforms:
      - name: instance
        image: image_name:tag
        exposed_ports:
          - "53/udp"
          - "53/tcp"
        published_ports:
          - "0.0.0.0:8053:53/udp"
          - "0.0.0.0:8053:53/tcp"

* Add custom nameserver to Docker container.
* Add network create and destroy support to Docker driver.

Breaking Changes
----------------

* The verifier's `additional_files_or_dirs` option is relative to the
  test directory, as opposed to the scenario directory.
* The verifier's `additional_files_or_dirs` option now supports regexp.
  Molecule will add additional files or directories, only when the glob
  succeeds.  Directories must be appended with the regexp to match, further
  details in the verifier's documentation.

2.7
===

* Ability to set a ulimit for the Docker driver.
* Switching log_driver from none to json-file to for compatibility with
  Ansible 2.2.

* Added `GCE Driver`_, `EC2 Driver`_, `LXC Driver`_, `LXD Driver`_ , and
  `OpenStack Driver`_ native Molecule drivers.

Breaking Changes
----------------

* Not compatible with Molecule v1 style config.

======

* Fix openstack driver login and ssh key generation.

1.14
====

* Made improvements to unit/functional tests.
* Fixed Goss verifier under Ansible 2.2.
* Removed testinfra config backward compatibility.
* Broke out role dependency into a subcommand.

Breaking Changes
----------------

* The testinfra override options have been moved to the `verifier` section of
  molecule's config.  No longer support a top level `testinfra` config key.
* The galaxy override options have been moved to the `dependencies` section of
  molecule's config.  No longer support a `galaxy` key inside the top level

1.12.3
======

* Write templates even when a custom ansible.cfg is specified.

1.12.2
======

1.12.1
======

* Preserve ansible.cfg when supplying a custom one.

1.12
====

* Additional command tests.
* Changed connection to ansible_connection.
* Implemented click vs docopt.  This slightly changes the CLI's semantics.
* Removed the driver python packages from installing with molecule.
* Set ssh key if specified in OpenStack driver.
* Using py.test as functional test runner.
* Added a Gemfile to ``molecule init`` serverspec verifier.
* Added SUSE docker driver support.
* Display the list of non-idempotent tasks with ``molecule idempotence``.

Breaking Changes
----------------

* The ``--debug`` flag is no longer passed to the subcommand.  The command and
  subcommand args were getting munged together, and passed to the core.  They
  are now handled separately.
* Removed the ``--debug`` subcommand flag from all usage -- it was never used.
* The ``init`` subcommand requires an optional ``--role`` flag vs a role
  argument when naming the role to initialize.
* The ``init`` subcommand requires a ``--driver`` flag when creating a driver
  other than vagrant.
* The ``init`` subcommand requires a ``--verifier`` flag when creating a
  verifier other than testinfra.
* The ``login`` subcommand requires a ``--host`` flag when more than one
  instance exists.
* One must install the appropriate python package based on the driver used.

1.11.5
======

* Added alpha Goss verifier support.
* Updated runtime requirements to current versions.
* Implemented ``molecule check`` subcommand.
* Configure verifier to be test kitchen like.
* Ability to declare multiple drivers in config.
* Implement ansible groups inheritance.

Breaking Changes
----------------

Previously molecule would execute a test framework based on the existence of a
directory structure.  This is no longer the case.  Molecule will execute the
configured suite, where `testinfra` is the default.  See docs.

1.10.3
======

* Reimplemented idempotence handling. Removed the idempotence ansible callback
  plugin, in favor of a native implementation.

Note
----

There is no change in workflow.  Molecule still reports if a converge was
idempotent or not.  However, it no longer reports which task(s) are not
idempotent.

1.10.2
======

* Removed pytest-xdist from runtime deps.  This allows testinfra's dependency
  on pytest to properly install.

1.10.1
======

* Pinned to explicit version of testinfra, due to pytest incompatabilities.

1.10
====

* Added ability to specify custom dockerfile.
* Added ability to generate and destroy temporary openstack keypair and ssh key
  file if they are not specified in the molecule.yml.

* Added docker volume mounting.
* Add support for Docker port bindings.
* Implemented a new core config class.

Breaking Changes

  structure for easier merging. In general it's more clear and easy to
  understand.
