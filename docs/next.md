# Molecule Next

Molecule "next" is the future major version of molecule, one that is currently
available from the main branch. This page documents all notable changes
implemented so far.

- `roles-path` and `collections-paths` are no longer configurable for
  dependencies. Users are expected to make use of `ansible.cfg` file to
  alter them when needed.
