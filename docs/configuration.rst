Configuration
=============

Prerun
------

In order to help Ansible find used modules and roles, molecule will perform
a prerun set of actions. These involve installing dependencies from
``requirements.yml`` specified at project level, install a standalone role
or a collection. The destination is ``project_dir/.cache`` and the code itself
is reused from ansible-lint, which has to do the same actions.

This assures that when you include a role inside molecule playbooks, Ansible
will be able to find that role, and that the include is exactly the same as
the one you are expecting to use in production.

If for some reason the prerun action does not suits your needs, you can still
disable it by adding `prerun: false` inside the configuration file.

Keep in mind that you can add this value to ``.config/molecule/config.yml``
file in order to avoid adding it to each scenario.


Variable Substitution
---------------------

There are following environment variables available in ``molecule.yml``:

================================  ===========================================================
  Variable                          Description

MOLECULE_EPHEMERAL_DIRECTORY      Path to generated directory, usually

.. _dependency:

Dependency
----------

Testing roles may rely upon additional dependencies.  Molecule handles managing
these dependencies by invoking configurable dependency managers.

Ansible Galaxy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. autoclass:: molecule.dependency.ansible_galaxy.AnsibleGalaxy()
   :undoc-members:

Shell
^^^^^

.. autoclass:: molecule.dependency.shell.Shell()
   :undoc-members:

.. _driver:

Driver
------

Molecule uses `Ansible`_ to manage instances to operate on.  Molecule supports
any provider `Ansible`_ supports.  This work is offloaded to the `provisioner`.

The driver's name is specified in `molecule.yml`, and can be overridden on the
command line.  Molecule will remember the last successful driver used, and
continue to use the driver for all subsequent subcommands, or until the
instances are destroyed by Molecule.

.. important::

    The verifier must support the Ansible provider for proper Molecule
    integration.

    The driver's python package requires installation.

Delegated
^^^^^^^^^

.. autoclass:: molecule.driver.delegated.Delegated()
   :undoc-members:

.. _lint:

Lint
----

Starting with v3, Molecule handles project linting by invoking and external
lint commands as exemplified below.

The decision to remove the complex linting support was not easily taken as we
do find it very useful. The issue was that molecule runs on scenarios and
linting is usually performed at repository level.

It makes little sense to perform linting in more than one place per project.
Molecule was able to use up to three linters and while it was aimed to flexible
about them, it ended up creating more confusions to the users. We decided to
maximize flexibility by just calling an external shell command.

.. code-block:: yaml

    lint: |
      set -e
      yamllint .
      ansible-lint
      flake8

The older format is no longer supported and you have to update the
``molecule.yml`` when you upgrade. If you don't want to do any linting,
it will be enough to remove all lint related sections from the file.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # old v2 format, no longer supported
    lint:
      name: yamllint
      enabled: true
    provisioner:
      lint:
        name: ansible-lint
      options: ...
      env: ...
    verifier:
      lint:
        name: flake8
