Molecule
========

Molecule is designed to aid in the development and testing of
`Ansible`_ roles including support for multiple instances, distributions, platforms and test frameworks.

It leverages `Vagrant`_ to manage virtual machines,
with support for multiple Vagrant providers (currently VirtualBox, Parallels and VMware Fusion)
and `Serverspec`_ or `Testinfra`_ to run tests.  Molecule uses an `Ansible`_
`playbook`_ (``playbook.yml``), to execute the `role`_ and its tests.

Some of the UI was inspired by `Test Kitchen`_.
