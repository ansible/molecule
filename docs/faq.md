# FAQ

## Why is my idempotence action failing?

It is important to understand that Molecule does not do anything further
than the default functionality of Ansible when determining if your tasks
are idempotent or not. Molecule will simply run the converge action
twice and check against Ansible's standard output.

Therefore, if you are seeing idempotence failures, it is typically
related to the underlying Ansible report and not Molecule.

If you are facing idempotence failures and intend to raise a bug on our
issue tracker, please first manually run `molecule converge` twice and
confirm that Ansible itself is reporting task idempotence (changed=0).

## Why does Molecule make so many shell calls?

Ansible provides a Python API. However, it is not intended for [direct
consumption](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_api.html).
We wanted to focus on making Molecule useful, so our efforts were spent
consuming Ansible's CLI.

Since we already consume Ansible's CLI, we decided to call additional
binaries through their respective CLI.

## Why does Molecule only support specific Ansible versions?

We can only test against a limited number of Ansible versions and often we
rely on bugfixes that were fixed only in recent versions of Ansible.

## Why are playbooks used to provision instances?

Simplicity. Ansible already supports numerous cloud providers. Too much
time was spent in Molecule v1, re-implementing a feature that already
existed in the core Ansible modules.

## Why not using Ansible's python API instead of playbooks?

This was
[evaluated](https://github.com/kireledan/molecule/tree/playbook_proto)
early on. It was a toss-up. It would provide simplicity in some
situations and complexity in others. Developers know and understand
playbooks. Decided against a more elegant and sexy solution.

## Why are there multiple scenario directories and molecule.yml files?

Again, simplicity. Rather than defining an all encompassing config file
opted to normalize. Molecule simply loops through each scenario applying
the scenario's molecule.yml.

## Are there similar tools to Molecule?

- Ansible's own [Testing
  Strategies](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/test_strategies.html)
- [RoleSpec](https://github.com/nickjj/rolespec)

## Can I run Molecule processes in parallel?

Please see [parallel-usage-example](examples.md#docker-with-non-privileged-user) for
usage.

## Can I specify random instance IDs in my molecule.yml?

This depends on the CI provider but the basic recipe is as follows.

Setup your `molecule.yml` to look like this:

```yaml
platforms:
  - name: "instance-${INSTANCE_UUID}"
```

Then in your CI provider environment, for example, Gitlab CI, setup:

```yaml
variables:
  INSTANCE_UUID: "$CI_JOB_ID"
```

Where `CI_JOB_ID` is the random variable that Gitlab provides.

Molecule will resolve the `INSTANCE_UUID` environment variable when
creating and looking up the instance name. You can confirm all is in
working order by running `molecule list`.

## Where can I configure my `roles-path` and `collections-paths`?

As of molecule v6, users are expected to make use of [`ansible.cfg`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html) file to
alter them when needed.

## Does Molecule support monorepos?

Yes, roles contained in a
[monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) with other roles are
automatically picked up and `ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH` is set accordingly. See
[this
page](examples.md#monolith-repo)
for more information.

## How can I add development/testing-only dependencies?

Sometimes, it's desirable to only run a dependency role when developing
your role with molecule, but not impose a hard dependency on the role
itself; for example when you rely on one of its side effects. This can
be achieved by an approach like this in your role's `meta/main.yml`:

```yaml
---
dependencies:
  - role: <your-dependee-role>
    when: lookup('env', 'MOLECULE_FILE')
```
